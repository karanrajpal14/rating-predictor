# Rating Predictor Flask App

This is the server for my final project that is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed [here](https://karanr.dev/rating-predictor)

In order to run this project locally, just clone the repo and run `python app.py` and you should see the Flask server running.

If you wish to deploy this app on Heroku, please zip this folder and upload it on Heroku and it should deploy automatically.
